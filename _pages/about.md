About
======
I am a doctoral research fellow at the [Digitial Signal Processing and Image Analysis (DSB)](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/groups/dsb/) group at University of Oslo, Norway.
My current research focuses on improving the stability and effectiveness of self-supervised learning (SSL) methods by leveraging high-level supervisory signals to guide training, under the advisement of Prof. [Adín Ramírez Rivera](https://adin.gitlab.io/) and Prof. [Michael Kampffmeyer](https://sites.google.com/view/michaelkampffmeyer).

Background
